Branches generally used for collabration

main Project-> frontend
            -> backend

            frontend    
                ->Dev1
                ->Dev2
                ->Dev3

                Dev3
                    ->D1
                    ->D2

            backend
                ->Follow some Branches also

People work parallel in this,
and merge them in the end.            



//Branch Commands
1.  git branch                      (to check current branch)
2.  git branch -M main              (to convert branch)
3.  git checkout branchName         (To move from one branch to another)
4.  git checkout -b branchName      (Create new branch)

    branchName -> like main, master.

5.  git branch -d branchName        (delete barnch)



i have 2 branch -> main, bug.
Since `bug` and `main` are separate branches,
changes pushed to `bug` won't affect `main` unless you merge them.
Now, set-upstream for bug branch by(git push)
